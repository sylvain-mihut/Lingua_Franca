# Tanslator

Welcome to the "Tanslator" project! This project is a multilingual translator developed with Flask and the `googletrans` library.

## Context

When working with multilingual content, it is often necessary to translate text from one language to another. "Tanslator" is a web application that facilitates translation by providing a simple and user-friendly interface to quickly translate text.

Whether you are a student, a professional, or simply curious about the meaning of text in another language, "Tanslator" allows you to enter text in the source language, select the source and target language, and obtain the corresponding translation with just one click.

## Features

- Automatic Translation: Enter text in the source language and select the source and target language to get the corresponding translation.
- Support for Multiple Languages: "Tanslator" supports a wide range of languages, allowing you to translate text between different languages.
- User-Friendly Interface: The simple and intuitive interface makes it easy to enter text, select languages, and obtain translations.

## Using the Google Translation API

This project uses the `googletrans` Python library to access the Google Translate API and perform translations. The `googletrans` library is an unofficial interface that does not require an API key to be used.

It allows for accurate translation between different languages. In this project, we use `googletrans` to translate the text entered by the user from the source language to the selected target language.

Please note that using `googletrans` without an API key may be subject to limitations of the Google Translate API, such as the number of requests allowed per day or per minute. Make sure to refer to the `googletrans` documentation for more information on any limitations.

## Using Flask

Flask is a minimalist web framework for Python. It makes it easy to create web applications by providing ready-to-use tools and features. In this project, Flask is used to handle HTTP requests, display HTML templates, and execute translation functionalities.

The Python code uses the Flask package to define the application routes, receive form data, perform translations using the `googletrans` library, and display the results in HTML templates.

Flask is a popular choice for Python web development due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of learning. It offers a lightweight yet powerful structure for quickly and efficiently building web applications.

Feel free to refer to the Flask documentation (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) to learn more about the features and possibilities provided by this framework.
